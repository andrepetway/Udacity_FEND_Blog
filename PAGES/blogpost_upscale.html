                <p>Mouth-watering. Dazzling. Succulent. Grandiose.</p>
            <p>Chef Josef Centeno should be very proud of the work he and 
            his crew put together each night for Orsa and Winston. Nestled 
            on the border between Skid Row and Little Tokyo is an unassuming 
            door leading to an intimate table space overseeing a skillful 
            kitchen. Flavor pairings are unlike anything I had ever had 
            before. Seafood is the protein throughout the courses. We opted 
            for the 5-course meal on the occasion of our anniversary. I am not 
            sure if the occasion had anything to do with the service, but in 
            the end we received 4 additional courses for a total of 9. Chef 
            started us with a dashi based custard topped with caviar and the 
            texture and warmth tasted great on the palate. It felt like 
            starting with a savory dessert. </p>

            <p>Absolutely incredible. <em class="under">Orsa and Winston boasts a 1-star on the 
            Michelin guide</em>, I would be delighted to frequent their eatery if I 
            had the means. A dinner for two along with drinks ran a little over 
            $400. The experience is worth every penny.</p>

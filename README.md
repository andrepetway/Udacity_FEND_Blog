# Udacity_FEND_Blog
<h2>Capstone Blog Project</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Welcome to my Capstone Blog Project! In this project, I’ll be leveraging the knowledge and skills I’ve gained throughout the Udacity Nanodegree program to propose a solution to a crafting a blog using markup and style language techniques.

<h3>Goal Statement</h3>
The goal of the blog is to implement responsive web design.

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul style = none;>
  <li><strong>Domain Background:</strong> The blog centers around food.
  <li><strong>Datasets and Inputs:</strong> Most imagery and all text copy was personally taken or drafted.
  <li><strong>Solution Statement:</strong> A combined utilization of grid template rows and columns along with media queries was the solution.
  <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong> Deploying the site via a LiveServer, I tested multiple iterations of different sized screens leveraging developer tools to emulate various mobile screen sizes under/over 768 pixels.
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
For the front-end development, I’ll be using HTML and CSS. Here’s how I plan to structure my project:
<p>
<br>
  <strong>HTML:</strong> I’ll create HTML elements for the different sections of my blog.
  <br>
  <strong>CSS:</strong> I’ll apply responsive design principles to ensure the blog looks great on various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile). To consolidate code, part of the capstone required linking several CSS sheets across the site.
  <br>
  <strong>ASSETS:</strong> Again, imagery and copy were personally taken or drafted.
